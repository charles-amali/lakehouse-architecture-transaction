A production-grade data pipeline that processes e-commerce transaction data using AWS services and Delta Lake. The system automatically handles data ingestion, validation, and storage while maintaining data quality and reliability.

## Key Features

### Automated Processing
- Automated ETL pipeline using AWS Glue
- Scheduled data processing with AWS Step Functions
- Automatic data validation and quality checks

### Reliable Storage
- Delta Lake tables for ACID compliance
- Partitioned tables for optimal performance
- Version control and time travel capabilities

### ✨ Data Quality
- Automated data validation
- Error handling and rejection tracking
- Referential integrity checks
- Duplicate detection and removal

### Analytics Ready
- Optimized for Amazon Athena queries
- Pre-configured table schemas
- Efficient partitioning strategy

## System Architecture

```plaintext
Raw Data (S3) → AWS Glue (Processing) → Delta Lake (Storage) → Athena (Analytics)
```

### Data Flow
1. Raw CSV files land in S3 (`/raw/`)
2. AWS Glue processes and validates data
3. Clean data stored in Delta format (`/processed/`)
4. Invalid records logged (`/rejected/`)
5. Archived data moved to long-term storage (`/archive/`)
